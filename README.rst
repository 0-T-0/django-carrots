========================
Django Carrots tutorials
========================

Tutorials walking new programmers through the process of building
their first website in Python and Django.

Loose outline

#. Installing Python and setting up development environment
#. Python basics
#. "Snakes!" online competition
#. Creating a polling application in Django
#. Deploying the application


Build instructions
==================

Just run::

  pip install -r requirements.txt
  make html

Documentation should be created in ``build/html`` directory.


Why Python 3?
=============

Because it's the future. Also, Python 3 makes it possible to skip the
whole section of the tutorial describing Unicode and character
encodings in general. There is no use in scaring newbies from the
start.
