<p>Geek Girls Carrots (otherwise known as GGC) seeks to foster an encouraging and supportive
learning environment in which individuals from all walks of life can comfortably participate,
regardless of race, color, ethnicity, age, religion, political affiliation, physical ability, sexual
orientation or socioeconomic staus.</p>
<p>Geek Girls Carrots is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community for everyone.
We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member in any form. This not only
extends to members of Geek Girls Carrots, but to anyone who chooses to become involved in the
larger Geek Girls Carrots community of users, developers and integrators through events or
interactions. Harassment includes offensive verbal/electronic comments related to personal
characteristics or choices; sexual images or comments in public or online spaces; deliberate
intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption
of talks, IRC (Internet Relay Chat), electronic meetings, physical meetings or other events;
inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any
harassing or bullying behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, representatives of the community may take
reasonable action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from any Geek
Girls Carrots event, or expulsion from mailing lists, IRC, discussion boards and other electronic
communications channels to resolve the issue. This may include rescinding Geek Girls Carrots
Membership in its entirety. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or
have any other concerns, please act to intercede or ask for help from any member of Geek Girls
Carrots, IRC Administrators, website Administrators, or Organizers/Representatives of any physical
events put on under the auspices of Geek Girls Carrots.</p>
